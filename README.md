# Leinster Trophy 
## Introduction
Leinster Trophy is a site all about the history of the Leinster Trophy and the people who have successfully competed in the motor race for which the trophy is awarded. The site is targetted towards people with an interest in the history of the race, the trophy, and previous winners. Leinster Trophy will be useful as a reference for those seeking information about the trophy or past race winners.

## UX
### Leinster Motor Club:
The trophy is the crown jewel of the Leinster Motor Club, who currently have a website in development. The Leinster Motor Club organise and run multiple motorsport based events each year, covering a variety of classes across both motorcar and motorbike disciplines. Therefore the Leinster Trophy race needs a site of its own to aid in the promotion of the signature event.

## Wireframe mockups
Initially I utilised Balsamiq to produce low fidelity wireframes to organise the site structure, potential content placement locations and test the size of each page.

* [Trophy page wireframe](https://github.com/MattBCoding/leinster-trophy/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-trophy.png)
* [Winners page wireframe](https://github.com/MattBCoding/leinster-trophy/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-winners.png)
* [Gallery page wireframe](https://github.com/MattBCoding/leinster-trophy/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-gallery.png)
* [Contact page wireframe](https://github.com/MattBCoding/leinster-trophy/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-contact.png)

Once the overall structure for each page had been established, I moved into figma to produce a full colour mockup to test the colour scheme and font selection. Once I was happy with the colours and font selection I also created a colour card to aid with the build process. To select the colours used I utilised the Adobe colour selector to pull the colours out of the hero image. As the hero image is of a racecar in a well known colour scheme, it allowed me to utilise it through out the site and keep on the theme.

## Features
In this section go over the different parts of the project, and describe each in a sentance or so. Explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things. 
### Common Features 
* Navigation Bar

  * The navigation bar features a common design across all five pages in keeping with convention with a logo on the left hand size and the navigation links on the right.
  * The navigation bar includes links on the logo, Home, Trophy, Winners, Gallery and Contact. The various title links head to their respective pages for easy navigation. The logo links back to the homepage as a typical shortcut users will likely be familiar with.
  * The navigation bar is fully responsive, for smaller screens, the format of the bar changes to a column orientation with the logo at the top centered on the page and the title links vertically aligned underneath. For tablets and screens in between there is a staggered change through the use of media queries in order to maximise its size.
  * A horizontal line appears under the current page as a visual indicator to the user as to which page they are currently on.

* Hero image

  * Each page includes a hero image with a text overlay which further indicates to the user exactly which section of the site they are on.
  * The image was careful chosen due to the historic race car within the image along with the iconic colour scheme as a visual reminder that the Leinster Trophy race is an event with a rich and long running history. The same colour scheme as the vehicle in the image was utilised throughout the site.

### Home Page Features

* Next race banner

  * The home page includes a banner providing details of the next Leinster Trophy race to occur. It includes the important details of which event it is, when it will happen and where it takes place.
  * There are two buttons included in the banner. They are indicated as Entry and Tickets. The entry button takes the user to the race entry website which is provided by the race venue Mondello Park. The ticket button takes the user to the ticket purchasing site which is provided by Irish Championship Circuit Racing. Both links open in new windows.
  * The banner also includes an image of two modern racecars competing on track as a visual indicator to the user that it is modern racecars that compete during the event.

* Statistics section
  
  * The main information section of the homepage provides the users with highlight statistics about the achievements of past competitors, reminding users that the Leinster Trophy race has launched the careers of some of the worlds greatest drivers.
  * For desktop and tablet layouts, the statistics are presented in the shape of a staggered motorsport grid. With each of the four cards lining up in position as would the racecars about to start a race. This format is reinforced by the yellow horizontal start line positioned at the start of the section, along with the grid box markings surrounding the cards.
  * The statistic cards provide easy access to some of the historical facts regarding the Leinster Trophy race.

## Testing
Here you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projects features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals. In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes. You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet. If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a seperate file and link to it from here.

## Validator Testing 
* HTML 
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Validator (link to validation results) 
* CSS
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official (Jigsaw) Validator (link to validation results)

## Unfixed bugs
you will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment 
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 
* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. the steps to deploy are as follows: 
  * in the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab 
  * From the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch 
  * One the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 
  
The live link can be found here - (include link to live site)

## Credits
in this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
