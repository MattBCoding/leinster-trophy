# Leinster Trophy 
## Introduction
Leinster Trophy is a site all about the history of the Leinster Trophy and the people who have successfully competed in the motor race for which the trophy is awarded. The site is targetted towards people with an interest in the history of the race, the trophy, and previous winners. Leinster Trophy will be useful as a reference for those seeking information about the trophy or past race winners.

## UX
### Leinster Motor Club:
The trophy is the crown jewel of the Leinster Motor Club, who currently have a website in development. The Leinster Motor Club organise and run multiple motorsport based events each year, covering a variety of classes across both motorcar and motorbike disciplines. Therefore the Leinster Trophy race needs a site of its own to aid in the promotion of the signature event.

## Testing
Here you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projects features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals. In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes. You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet. If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a seperate file and link to it from here.

## Validator Testing 
* HTML 
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Validator (link to validation results) 
* CSS
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official (Jigsaw) Validator (link to validation results)

## Unfixed bugs
you will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment 
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 
* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. the steps to deploy are as follows: 
  * in the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab 
  * From the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch 
  * One the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits
in this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
