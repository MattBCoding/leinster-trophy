Welcome MattBCoding,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!

#README START ##Introduction Provide a summary overview of the project. The sales pitch. What it hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience.

#UX ##Leinster Motor Club: The trophy is the crown jewel of the leinster motor club, who currently have a website in development. The leinster trophy race needs a site of its own to promote it in its own right. What it needs to include what they need to get out of it

#User stories *As a user I want to easily find information about the race *As a user I want to easily find information about past winners of the race *As a user I want to easily find out about the history of the trophy *As the organisation we want to promote the trophy and increase its prestige *As the organisation we want to capture a larger social media following *As the organisation we want to be able to market directly to interested parties in a cost effective manner

#Opportunities arising from user stories Insert oppotunities table, opportunities/Importance/Viability/Feasibility

#Wireframe mockups Include screen shots from balsamic for the wireframe mockups one for each page - include differences between mobile, tablet and desktop views.

##Features In this section go over the different parts of the project, and describe each in a sentance or so. Explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things. ###Existing Features *Navigation Bar *Details of the nav bar *include image *Landing page image - hero image *Details of the section *include image *Next race section *details of the section *include image *statistics section *details of the section *include image *navigation element - shortcut *details of the shortcut *image of the shortcut *Footer section *footer upper details - newsletter signup *include image *footer lower details *include image *Trophy Page *History of the Trophy section *include image *Winners page *Winners and Podium finishers data table *Download link to full data file *inlcude images *Gallery page *Video gallery - autoplay footage from prior year - youtube embedded - muted - autoplay *Image gallery *include images *Contact Page *Contact form to receive enquiries *include image

##Feature left to implement *other feature ideas *why they were not included

##Testing Here you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projects features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals. In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes. You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet. If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a seperate file and link to it from here.

##Validator Testing *HTML *No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Validator (link to validation results) *CSS *No errors were returned when passing through the official (Jigsaw) Validator (link to validation results)

##Unfixed bugs you will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

##Deployment This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) *The site was deployed to GitHub pages. the steps to deploy are as follows: *in the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab *From the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch *One the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. The live link can be found here - (include link to live site)

##Credits in this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

##Content *The text for the home page was taken from *Instruction on how to implement form validation on the sign up page was taken from (link to specific youtube tutorial) *the icons in the footer were taken from font awesome(link to font awesome)

##Media *The photos used on the homepage and sign up page are from this open source site *the images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site
